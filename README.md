Object Classification Comparison using Real vs. Synthetic Data

We have two research objectives: 

1. Accurately identify 20 classes from a publicly available dataset 

2. (as an extension) â€“ Investigate whether user-generated synthetic datasets can be used to train object detection models to accurately identify objects of interest in public datasets or other citizen media material? 


Phase 1 of our project involves the publicly available PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, which contains approximately 11,500 images with more than 27,000 annotated regions of interest (ROI) and almost 7,000 segmentations. Additionally, this image dataset contains 20 classes that can be grouped into 4 main categories: person (1 class), animal (6 classes), vehicle (7 classes), and indoor objects (6 classes).


Phase 2, which is an extension of our project, involves 8,000 synthetic images generated using the Unity computer graphics engine. 

To test models in both Phase 1 and Phase 2, we created an tet dataset of 500+ augmented ITO-EN 500 mL green tea bottle with varying hue, brightness, and saturation.
